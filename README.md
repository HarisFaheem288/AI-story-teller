**StoryCraft AI** is a Streamlit-based interactive dashboard that brings your creative ideas to life!  
Enter a short story idea, and the app will:

1. **Generate an original story** (without copying background text).
2. **Create an AI-generated image** to match the story.
3. **Narrate the story** using realistic text-to-speech — playback starts only when you click a button.

## 💡 Tips

* For best performance, run on a machine with a GPU (CUDA supported).
* The `sd-turbo` model is chosen for speed; you can swap with any SD model on Hugging Face.
* You can tweak **temperature** and **max\_new\_tokens** in the code for more creative control.
